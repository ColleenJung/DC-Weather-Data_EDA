# Exploring Weather Data with Vector Auto Regression Model, PCA, and K-Means Clustering

## About the Dataset
### Context
This dataset has been curated to provide a comprehensive overview of weather patterns, facilitating predictive analysis for future weather conditions.

### Content
The dataset includes historical and projected weather data spanning from October 1, 2010, to October 31, 2023.

## Key Techniques
This project utilizes the following key techniques and concepts:

- **Vector Auto Regression Model**: A VAR model is a statistical technique used for modeling the relationships between multiple time series variables. In this context, it aids in understanding the dependencies and trends in weather data over time.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. It helps identify patterns and reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data, allowing for more efficient analysis and visualization.

- **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. It can be applied to weather data to identify clusters of similar weather patterns, aiding in forecasting and understanding regional trends.

These techniques are leveraged to gain valuable insights from the weather data, enabling better understanding and prediction of future weather conditions.
